# CLI Toolkit

A personal command-line toolkit for automating common Linux tasks such as
file management, backups, and system inspection.

## Goals
- Simple, predictable CLI commands
- Safe defaults (dry-run where applicable)
- Configurable via file
- Terminal-first, no GUI

## Planned Commands
- `rename` – bulk rename files safely
- `backup` – create timestamped backups
- `info` – show system or project information

## Non-Goals
- Web UI
- Cloud dependency
- OS-specific hacks (where possible)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Initial CLI scaffold
- [ ] Implement `rename` command
- [ ] Implement `backup` command
- [ ] Configuration file support
- [ ] Logging and error handling
- [ ] Tests
